# burger
This is week 14 homework
In this project I attempted to create an app that would showcase what burgers the user has devoured.
I used handlebars, sql, and javascript for this assignment. I was able to get the website working locally, but again am having trouble posting it to heroku.
I am also having problems with showing that a button has been pushed and printing what I want to print.
